# Auto-Generated Examples

*Last updated: 2024-09-26*

This section contains automatically generated examples showing Earth-OSM usage with different regions and infrastructure types.

## Available Examples

### Power Infrastructure

- [Monaco](monaco_power_example.md) - Complete power infrastructure analysis

## About These Examples

These examples are automatically generated to demonstrate Earth-OSM capabilities:

- **Small regions** are used for quick processing and clear visualization
- **Multiple infrastructure types** show the variety of data available
- **Real data** extracted from OpenStreetMap via GeoFabrik
- **Reproducible code** that you can run yourself

## Usage

Each example includes:

1. **Overview** with basic statistics
2. **Complete code** for data extraction and visualization  
3. **Generated maps** showing the infrastructure
4. **Statistical analysis** of the data
5. **Data samples** with column descriptions

## Customization

You can easily adapt these examples:

- Change the region to any [supported region](../regions.md)
- Extract different infrastructure types
- Modify the visualization style
- Add your own analysis

## Automation

These examples are regenerated automatically to keep the documentation current with:

- Latest Earth-OSM features
- Updated data from OpenStreetMap
- Current API usage patterns

To generate new examples, run:

```bash
python scripts/generate_docs_examples.py --max-regions 2 --clean
```
